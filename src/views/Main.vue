  <h1>Hey, my name is Stanislav</h1>
  <p>
    I do full stack web development, based in Valencia, Spain. VueJS is my main
    driver in front end, but I'm also very comfortable with React. The backend
    is either NodeJS with Express, o .NET Core.
  </p>
  <p>If I can, I always choose to use Typescript.</p>
